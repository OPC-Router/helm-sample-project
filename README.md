## **General Information**
> This is a project sample for the opc router helm chart.
> It is for demonstrating how to deploy a opc router project from a git repository with the helm chart.
> [Read more about the OPC Router Helm Chart here.](https://github.com/OPC-Router/helm-charts)

### **What is the sample doing?**
- This sample is a fully functional OPC Router 4 project sample.
- It is a very simple project that will periodically write a file in the home directory of the docker container it is deployed in.
- The written file is a text file containing the by the config.yaml configured string and a random number.

# Getting Started

## **Prequisites**
- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.1.0

## **Installation**
You can install this project on any kubernetes cluster using the helm chart with this command:
```shell
$ helm install my-opcrouter <Hier Pfad einfÃ¼gen> \
  --set project.projectRepo=https://github.com/OPC-Router/helm-sample-project.git \
  --set project.Path=Sampleproject.rpe \
  --set project.configPath=config.yaml \
  --set I_do_accept_the_EULA=true
```
This command will install the opc router with standard settings, as a service with a seperate mongodb container. The mongodb won't require authentification, which is not recommended. Accepting the [End User License Agreement](https://www.opc-router.com/terms-of-use-and-eula/) by setting `I_do_accept_the_EULA` to true is required for the OPCRouter to run.

## **Uninstalling**
The chart with the name `my-opcrouter` can simply be uninstalled by executing:
```shell
$ helm uninstall my-opcrouter
```
However, keep in mind that the persitant volumes of the mongodb container don't get deleted by this. When reinstalling the chart under the same name you will have to use the previous mongodb root password and replica set key or delete the persistant volume beforehand.
